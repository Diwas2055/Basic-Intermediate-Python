# WebSocket
    ->  A WebSocket is a standard protocol for two-way data transfer between a client and server. 
        The WebSockets protocol does not run over HTTP, instead it is a separate implementation on top of TCP.

    ->  A WebSocket connection allows full-duplex communication between a client and server so that either side can push data to
        the other through an established connection.
